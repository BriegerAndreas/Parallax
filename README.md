Overall, this SCSS code exercise provides a structured approach to creating a visually appealing parallax scrolling effect on a webpage.

    General Styles: Sets basic styles for the HTML body, such as removing margins and padding, and setting the font family and size.

    Mixin Declarations: Defines mixins for common styling patterns like center alignment and full-width background images.

    Navbar Styles: Styles the navigation bar with a teal background color and centers its content vertically.

    Parallax Wrapper Styles: Defines styles for the main container of the parallax effect. It sets the height to 100% of the viewport height, enables vertical scrolling, and adds perspective for 3D effects.

    Intro and Outro Screens: Styles the intro and outro screens of the parallax effect. The intro screen has a background image that fades to transparent at the bottom, while the outro screen has a solid teal background color.

    Parallax Group Styles: Defines styles for each layer of the parallax effect. Layers are stacked on top of each other and move at different speeds to create the parallax effect.

    Layer-Specific Styles: Sets specific styles for different layers within each parallax group. For example, the base layer is scaled up and moved closer to the viewer, while the top layer is scaled down and moved farther away.

    Z-Index and Background Color: Sets z-index values and background colors for specific elements to control their stacking order and appearance.
